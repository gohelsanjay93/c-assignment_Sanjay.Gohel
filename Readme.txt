Hello My name is Sanjay Gohel

here i gave some importent points about my project

1)I have used UI template from internet 

2)I have used Bootstrap css and Js

3)I have Used Jquery for dom manipulation

4)Also i have use chain dropdown for Country ,state and city

5)Also have used some methods from internet 
So here is importents that before you go forward make sure you use correct data because every where you go i have applied validation and filters.


Here in this project first thing is that user must do register

Then User receives link in mail and then by clicking mail user get verified.

After that user logged in system then and the user can add the product and Edit the products.

User also can edit profile data but here is one point is that we can not let them change all data like email and contact number because is the way to approach them.

Thats all from my side

Thanks for Reading.
